PROBLEM DEFINITION: 
Sentiment Analysis with 55.000 Tweets
Text can be presented in two different styles: formal and informal writing style. A text may contain a lot of emotion, ideas or feelings. Twitter texts are generally informal and depending on the topic, they contain emotions of the writers. Social media users can freely express their feelings, views, opinions and emotion on social networking site. Short messages like SMS, tweets or Facebook messages are also useful source for sentiment analysis. Because of length constraints in these messages, Opinion Mining might be a bit difficult.
The scope of this project is to predict the sentiment of a short twitter text and categorize them over 3 sentiments (positive, negative, neutral). Since the twitter texts are simple, short, informal and contain creative spelling and punctuation, misspellings, slang, new words or URLs ; handling with that type of text would be harder to classify in terms of sentiments. Thus, analyzing and categorizing the emotional content of twitter text data is an important solution to create a corpus of tweets and texts with sentiment expressions.
